While extracting **the areas of interest** from an image, the parameters and techniques used for the constraints affected the **image recognition accuracy**. 

To solve this problem, my teammates and I have proposed several solutions. The first was to **add the judgment of different environmental conditions** directly. Yet too much if-elses, or other judgemental statement impacting the recognition efficiency. Second, the **camera was adjusted in its control parameters** so that it automatically adapted to changes in environmental lighting. However, this method involved hardware programming and should take time to contact the supplier of the camera. 

In order to find the best solution for image extraction, **I was responsible for the part of using several attempts to find the best way of image processing**. 

After a series of code optimization and experiments, we **combined these two solutions** to solve the problem. 

Video example 2-2.avi is one of the processed videoes where the camera was adjusted. I use these videoes to test my part of the program.
